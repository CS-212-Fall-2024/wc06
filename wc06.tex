    \titledquestion{Delphi}
    For a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ and a function $f: L \to \Sigma^*$ an oracle is a magic machine $O$ that on given input $x \in L$ outputs $f(x)$. We do not need to concern with how $O$ works, it just works. 

    A boolean variable $x$ is a variable that can have two values, \textbf{True} (represented as $1$) or \textbf{False} (represented as $0$). A boolean literal is either a boolean variable or its complement, if $x$ is a boolean variable, then the literals are $x$ and $\neg x$. A boolean formula is a formula consisting of boolean variables and logical connectives ($\land$, $\lor$, $\neg$). A formula is said to be in conjunctive normal form if it contains clauses which is a series of literals connected by logical disjunction $\lor$ and those clauses are connected by logical conjunction. A formula is said to be in 3 conjunctive normal form or 3CNF for short if each clause contains at most three literals. An example of a formula in 3CNF can be, $\phi = (x \lor \neg x \lor y) \land (\neg y \lor \neg x) \land (z \lor \neg y \lor \neg z) \land (x)$. The satisfying assignment to $\phi$ is a valid truth assignment to literals of $\phi$ such that $\phi$ evaluates to to \textbf{True} (1). If there exists a satisfying assignment of $\phi$ then $\phi$ is said to be satisfiable.

    Let $L = \{\phi \in \{u,0,1,(,),\land, \lor, \neg\}^*|$ $\phi$ is a boolean formula in 3CNF$\}$. Now we define the infamous computational problem called $\textsc{3-sat}$ as, $\textsc{3-sat} = \{\phi \in L|$ $\phi$ is $\phi$ is satisfiable$\}$. With this consider the function $f:\textsc{3-sat} \to \{u,0,1,(,),\land, \lor, \neg\}^*$ such that for $\phi \in \textsc{3-sat}$, $f(\phi)$ is the satisfying assignment of $\phi$. Now suppose we have an oracle for $f$, with this we construct a new language $\textsc{oracle-3-sat} = \{f(\phi) | \; \phi \in \textsc{3-sat}\}$.
    
    Show that \textsc{oracle-3-sat} is context free.
